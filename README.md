Russian-Belarusian neural translator

Hello. This project is my dyplom thesis about neural translation for language pair Russian-Belarussian.
This repository will contain aligned source data (429k sentences), chunks to align and neural network code.

This is open-source project, so you can use data and model for your own projects.
I will be glad to get some reviews for this work.

Tsimafei Prakapenka.
