Russian-Belarusian neural translator

Hello. 
This project is my dyplom thesis about neural translation for language pair Russian-Belarussian.

This repository will contain aligned source data (429k sentences), chunks to align and neural network code.
'TabbedCorpusMiddleSent.txt' was created from full corpus for training small models. It contains 65k sentences limited to 80 symbols.

This is open-source project, so you can use data and model for your own goals.
I will be glad to get some reviews for this work.

Tsimafei Prakapenka.
